# Cotton-Disease
Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the seeds.

The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa. Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds.

The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; fragments of cotton fabric dated to the fifth millennium BC have been found in the Indus Valley Civilization, as well as fabric remnants dated back to 6000 BC in Peru. Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.

Current estimates for world production are about 25 million tonnes or 110 million bales annually, accounting for 2.5% of the world's arable land. India is the world's largest producer of cotton. The United States has been the largest exporter for many years. In the United States, cotton is usually measured in bales, which measure approximately 0.48 cubic meters (17 cubic feet) and weigh 226.8 kilograms (500 pounds).

## Diseases
Category : Fungal
Alternaria leaf spot Alternaria macrospora
## Symptoms
Small, circular brown lesions on cotyledons and seedling leaves which expand and develop a concentric pattern; necrotic areas coalesce and often have a purple margin; centers of lesions may dry out and drop form the plant creating a "shot-hole" appearance on the leaves.
Cause
Fungus

Plants stressed by drought, nutrient deficiency and other pests are more susceptible to the disease; fungus spreads rapidly in dense canopies, especially during periods of warm, wet weather.
Management
Plow crop residue into the soil to reduce inoculum levels; provide plants with adequate irrigation and nutrients, particularly potassium; applications of appropriate foliar fungicides may be required on susceptible cultivars.
Asochyta blight Asochyta gossypii

## Symptoms
Brown or gray spots on leaves surrounded by a red halo; elongated red-purple cankers on stems cause the wilting and death of leaves above.
Cause
Fungus

Disease emergence is favored by cool, wet weather.
Management
No fungicides are currently registered for use in cotton; plow crop debris into soil after harvest; crop rotation has little to no effect of control of disease.
Cercospora leaf spot Cercospora gossypina

## Symptoms
Circular red lesions on leaves which enlarge and turn white or gray in the center; lesions often have a pattern of concentric rings and possess a red margin; dark gray spore masses form in the centers of the lesions making them appear dark gray.
Cause
Fungus

Fungus overwinters in crop debris from previous growing season; commonly found alongside Alternaria leaf spot and other foliar disease.
Management
Plow crop residue into the soil to reduce inoculum levels; provide plants with adequate irrigation and nutrients; applications of appropriate foliar fungicides may be required on susceptible cultivars.
Fusarium wilt Fusarium oxysporum
